          Yeah, kinda niche, right? When I first started my design career, my
          biggest hurdle was deciding what to design. I wanted to create this
          little generator as a way for fellow designers to quickly find some
          inspiration and just do the damn thing.

          I built the original Briefz.biz in 2016 on Github Pages, and didn't
          think much of it after I put it out into the world. Little did I know,
          years later, it would be featured in blog posts, tweets, and TikToks.
          It's been incredible to see people create work based on these briefs.
          I finally decided to move Briefz over to Webflow, where it's easier
          for me to maintain and add new briefs and features. So stay tuned,
          more to come!
